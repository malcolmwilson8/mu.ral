# mu.ral

This repo houses the code for my final Founders & Coders bootcamp project, mu.ral, a minimalistic, freeform drawing app.

My influences for this project come from [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/), [blender](https://www.blender.org/about/) and [bomomo](https://bomomo.com/).

## Aims

With mu.ral, I intend to make use of the HTML 5 Canvas API to render "brush" strokes. This is my first project created with Canvas, and I want to explore and learn about as much of its functionality as possible for future projects.

I aim to incorporate a 3D drawing mode into mu.ral to enhance the interactivity of the app, making full use of the canvas space available.

I want the app to let users:

- [x] Draw coloured lines on a canvas when they click and drag
- [x] Customise line width (create a PhotoShop style sliding brush size bar)
- [x] Customise line colour (with a draggable colour selector)
- [ ] Download drawings as images

## Stretch Goal

- [ ] Integrate three.js with the app, adding 3D functionality

## Installation

From your text editor, use `git clone https://github.com/malcolmwilson8/mu.ral.git` to install the repo files.
