# mu.ral

This repo houses the code for my final Founders & Coders project, mu.ral, a freeform drawing app.

## Aims

With this app, I will make use of the HTML 5 Canvas API to render "brush" strokes. I want the app to let users:

- [x] Draw coloured lines on a canvas when they click and drag
- [ ] Customise line width (create a PhotoShop style sliding brush size bar) 
- [ ] Customise line colour (with a draggable colour selector)
- [ ] Download drawings as images

## Stretch Goal

- [ ] Integrate three.js with the app, adding 3D functionality

## Installation

From your text editor, use `git clone https://github.com/malcolmwilson8/mu.ral.git` to install the repo files.
